Pelican based Blog
==================

This is the source code of my [blog][], using the Pelican static-site generator.

Reminder of how to use this project:

1. Setup the virtualenv.
2. Use _make devserver_ to start listing for changes and start a server on port 8000.
3. _make publish_ To generate the final html with production settings.
